### Paper Abstract
###### The rapid development of telecommunications and  cellular  network  technologies gave birth to a range of services and scenarios that were considered impossible a decade ago. Various architectures, scenarios and use-cases can be deployed on top of the different generations of cellular networks to solve different business cases. Some scenarios require a high level of reliability due to their critical usage (i.e., Vehicular Edge computing, medical IoT). When offering services at the edge of the network, the information exchanged needs to be current and valid for systematic performance assessment and modelling. However,  in order to run experiments, access to  valid  and reliable  telecommunication  data  (e.g.  eNodeB (Base Station)  properties,  and configurations)  is not easy, since in most cases data is either confidential  or  at  least  difficult  to  obtain, especially when dealing with cross organisational boundaries (e.g., data coming from multiple telecom operators). To bridge this gap and allow researchers to build, test and analyse new protocols and algorithms using reliable telecommunication data, we designed a mobile data generator (DG) for multi-domain cellular networks. Our generator provides a range of possible configurations and handles scenarios that include multiple participants, authorities  and  organizations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of our generator. We evaluated the data generator by considering different scenarios, specifically, we have tested service interruptions and mobile network migration since  these  scenarios  require  considerable  amount of data.
